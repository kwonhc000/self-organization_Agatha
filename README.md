# Literary Systems as Complex Adaptive Systems: A Study of Motif Self-Organization in Agatha Christie's 66 Detective Novels

This repository contains the code, processed datasets, and analysis results supporting the research paper submitted to *Digital Scholarship in the Humanities*.

## Abstract

This study empirically demonstrates that literary works function as complex adaptive systems by analyzing the 56-year evolution of core motifs in Agatha Christie's 66 detective novels (1920-1976, totaling 4,243,056 words) from a complexity theory perspective.

## Key Findings

- **48%** of motifs (12/25) showed significant temporal correlations (|r| > 0.2, p < 0.05)
- **20** strong inter-motif correlations (|r| > 0.3) demonstrate co-evolutionary phenomena  
- **1935** identified as critical transition point with 12 motifs changing simultaneously
- **Shannon entropy decrease** (4.382 â†’ 4.177) quantifies system self-organization
- **5 semantic clusters** emerged: legal/judgment, physical evidence, crime structure, spatial/atmospheric, character types

## Methodology

Hybrid approach combining:

- **Time series analysis** with 5-year moving averages
- **Network analysis** and correlation detection
- **K-means clustering** and critical point identification
- **Shannon entropy** calculation for self-organization measurement

## 25 Core Motifs
